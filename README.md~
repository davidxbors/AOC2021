# Adevent of Code 2021

This is the home of my Advent of Code 2021 solutions. I will try to solve all of the challenges if my free time allows it.

I would usually write the solutions in C, but I thought to take on a challenge and write the solutions in Nim, a language I don't know yet but that I hope to learn through this experience.
